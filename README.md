# image-preview
Sometimes site contain a lot of similar iamges. When adding an image to an image property or the a Content Area it’s difficult to determinate which content to select based on the small thumbnail and a name that may not be descriptive. The Editor has to open the image to see the full version, but by doing so he loses the context of the page he is editing. That’s why I prepared Image Preview nuget package. This is a small extension to Assets Pane that allows Editor to see a preview of an image, without having to change the context.
